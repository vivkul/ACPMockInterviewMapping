To avoid same student getting more than one interview:


To avoid same student fill the form twice but instead update it 

To update AlumniAdded:
INSERT INTO table (id, name, age) VALUES(1, "A", 19) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE    
name=VALUES(name), age=VALUES(age)



On matching, move the selected students to studentsAdded

All fields in the form are required

Mail the students that they have been shortlisted so that they are ready for interview even if they don't know the interviewer// TODO??

Mail all the students at a particular time as decided beforehand

Secure the webserver, don't allow bad values through the form(sql-injection) or form-bypassing.

Automate the entire process

Optimise the algorithm.
