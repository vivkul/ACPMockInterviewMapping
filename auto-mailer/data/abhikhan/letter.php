Dear Professor ".$prof.",
I, Abhishek Khandelwal,  am a Junior Undergraduate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India. I am writing to enquire if you have a vacancy for the position of a research intern during May - July, 2015.

I started reading question papers to get an idea about the current research problems and the opportunities in this field and thus during that I came across your research paper '".$paper."'. I was greatly intrigued by your work and found it coherent with my interests.I am planning to pursue a Masters in Mechanical Engineering and go for a PhD in the same after my B.Tech.

My interests primarily lie in 'Mechanics of Materials and Mechatronics'. In Last summer, I did a project similar to it that involves measurement of stresses in materials such as epoxy, aluminium and steel with the help of strain gauges and processes like photo elasticity. I also have laboratory experience in measurement and analysis of hardness, Fatigue, Crack Growth and Crystal Structures of various materials.

I wish to pursue research under your guidance or would be glad even if I could assist you in any of your current research projects. I am genuinely interested and enthusiastic to carry out productive research in the field of Material properties. An opportunity to work under your guidance would help me gain a lot of knowledge about different materials and also help exercise my engineering skills .

I am quite familiar with software like Lab View. I have a strong background in Mechanics of Solids and I am extremely curious about the science associated with Material strength properties. I have credited courses like Advanced Mechanics of Solids, Nature and Properties of Materials, Manufacturing Science and Technology and Composite Material Properties. 

I am willing to study anything that I am required to know before working under you. My detailed curriculum vitae and Laboratory work can be found on the following links:

Should you require more information, I would be glad to provide it.

I will follow-up by dropping an email at the same address within a few days to check if my qualifications aid my chances of working as an intern under you.

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,
Abhishek Khandelwal
